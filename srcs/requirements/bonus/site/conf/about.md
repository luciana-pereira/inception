Hello, my name is Luciana Pereira, I'm a student at 42SP and a Full Stack Developer at Avanade for over 3 years.

This page was developed as part of the bonus for the Inception project. We had to choose a new service to install. I chose "hugo" which allows you to easily create websites with an open source static website generator.
